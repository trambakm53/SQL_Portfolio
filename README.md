###Project 1: Indian Startup Funding (In-depth analysis)
* Analyzed the Indian start-up funding data to get a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched startups.
* Another important point to understand how funding changes with time is an important aspect.
* Possible areas of interest would be â€“ (Funding ecosystem and time relation, cities as an important factor, which industries, important investors).
* The dataset that I have used contains information of the funding of startups from January 2015 to August 2017. The amount invested is in USD. Aggregation of data w.r.t cities, investors, funding type, etc. is required to get an optimized result. Here I have done a major preprocessing of data and overcame the problem of missing data and uncertain distributions. Also, Visualizations are done to find the anomalies and mining patterns from data. It seems to be some cities showing some abnormal behavior when it comes to funding.


### Project2: SQL Case Studies (Capstone Analysis)
* Welcome to my SQL Case Study where I am using a dataset from mode.com.
* You can go to mode.com and work on the datasets provided by them. They have a huge resource of datasets to practice.

Steps I followed:
* Login to mode.com
* Export the required dataset(by default .csv format.
* Open your MySQL Workbench.
* Create a new database 'casestudies' using the command 'create database case studies'
* Run the SQL command 'use casestudies' to work in the specific database
* Import the .csv dataset downloaded from mode.com
* The .csv dataset will be imported into the current database i.e., 'casestudies'
* Run 'Select * from table_name' to view your imported dataset.

Once all the above steps are performed successfully, jump right into deriving insights from your data.
