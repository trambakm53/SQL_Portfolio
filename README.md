### Work Experience: 
Data Analyst @Target Retail 

### Technical Skills: 
* Programming Languages: Python, SQL (Hive & Post-gre), Pyspark.
* Visualization Tools: Tableau, Domo.

###Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1,000 job descriptions from Glassdoor using Python and Selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on Python, excel, AWS, and Spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest regressions using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client-facing API using flask

###Project 2: Ball Image Classifier: Project Overview
* For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country.
* They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
* I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.
* In most cases, this would meet the needs of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
