###Project 1: Indian Startup Funding (In-depth analysis)
* Analyzed the Indian start-up funding data to get a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched startups.
* Another important point to understand how funding changes with time is an important aspect.
* Possible areas of interest would be â€“ (Funding ecosystem and time relation, cities as an important factor, which industries, important investors).
* The dataset that I have used contains information of the funding of startups from January 2015 to August 2017. The amount invested is in USD. Aggregation of data w.r.t cities, investors, funding type, etc. is required to get an optimized result. Here I have done a major preprocessing of data and overcame the problem of missing data and uncertain distributions. Also, Visualizations are done to find the anomalies and mining patterns from data. It seems to be some cities showing some abnormal behavior when it comes to funding.
